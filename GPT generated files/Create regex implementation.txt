I am working with .net6 and c#. I need to compose a function with a single regular expression that successfully meets requirements below: 
-This regular expression should validate the maximum string length (passed as parameter); it should return a match if the string length is within the acceptable range and a non-match if it is not. 
-This regular expression should also validate that the string contains at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one digit, and one special character from a predefined list: !"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~. It should return a match if the criteria are met and a non-match if they are not. 
-This regular expression should validate that the string does not contain any whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, or newlines). This should return a non-match if any whitespace characters are found. 
-The regular expression should be optimized for execution speed and simplicity.

The task you've described can be achieved using a combination of positive lookaheads and a negative lookahead in a single regular expression pattern.

Here's how you can structure the regex to meet the requirements:

Use positive lookaheads (?=...) to ensure the string contains at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one digit, and one special character.
Use a negative lookahead (?!...) to ensure the string does not contain any whitespace characters.
Use ^.{min,max}$ to validate the length of the string, where min and max are your minimum and maximum string length respectively.
Now, let's build the regex:

(?=.*[A-Z]): This positive lookahead ensures there is at least one uppercase letter.
(?=.*[a-z]): This positive lookahead ensures there is at least one lowercase letter.
(?=.*\d): This positive lookahead ensures there is at least one digit.
(?=.*[!"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@\[\]^_{|}~])`: This positive lookahead ensures there is at least one special character from your predefined list.
(?!.*\s): This negative lookahead ensures there are no whitespace characters.
Now, let's put it all together to build the regex that checks for a string of length max:

csharp
Copy code
public bool ValidateString(string input, int maxLength)
{
    string pattern = $@"^(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*\d)(?=.*[!""#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@\[\]^_`{{|}}~])(?!.*\s).{{1,{maxLength}}}$";
    
    return Regex.IsMatch(input, pattern);
}
In this function, replace maxLength with your desired maximum string length. If you also have a minimum length (let's say minLength), you can replace the {1,maxLength} part with {minLength,maxLength}.

This regex pattern meets all of your criteria and is also fairly optimized in terms of speed and simplicity.
